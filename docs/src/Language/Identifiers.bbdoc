+Identifiers

Identifiers are used to name constants, variables, functions and user defined types.

Identifiers start with a letter or underscore and can be followed by any combination of letters, digits or underscores. For example, the following are all valid identifiers:
{{
player1_up
your_name
_hello_world_
}}
Identifiers in BlitzMax are case-insensitive. This means that the identifiers @hello, @Hello and @HELLO are all treated as the same identifier.

The following identifiers are reserved for use by the BlitzMax language, and can not be used as general purpose identifiers:
