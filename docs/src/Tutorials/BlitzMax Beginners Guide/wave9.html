A type is like a structure or a blueprint of variables. It's like a skeleton you define, you can then use this skeleton for animals or objects you create. Types are the part of BlitzMax which makes it an OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language. Types are one of the hardest parts to get around if you are new to OOP or programming in general. Make a new file if you want to try the examples that follow.</td></tr>

There is no rule that says we need to have our type at the top of our file, types are like functions in this case. They can be declared almost anywhere except inside of another type. You can even keep them in separate files which is common when working with oop.</td></tr>

This did not create a ship we merely made a placeholder for one. We are now ready to create a spaceship, which will be an instance of our structure; an object.</td></tr>

What I did above is declare a variable ship to use the spaceship structure. Then I created a new spaceship which is an object (an instance of spaceship) and I put this new spaceship into the variable ship (at least the address to it). I can now set the fields of this object using ship.spaceshipfieldname. If we don't create a new ship, our ship will be = null; it will not exist. 
To access the field of this new object called ship we use dot, you can see it as if the dot means "step into".</td></tr>

let's create another ship:</td></tr>

<span class="cw">ship2.name =</span><span class="cg"> "Starbreaker"</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="idx2" colspan="2"><br>
Now I have two objects of the SpaceShip Type, Ship and Ship2. I can always use the fields of these objects as a variable.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="idx2" colspan="2"><br>For example:</td><tr>
<tr>
  <td class="code" colspan="2"> 
<span class="cy">If</span><span class="cw"> ship.maxspeed ></span><span class="cb"> 200</span> <span class="cy">Then</span><span class="cw"> Ship.Name =</span><span class="cg"> "LightBreaker"</span></td></tr>
<tr><td class="idx2" colspan="2"><br> 
Note that if I would set Ship2 = Ship then both Ship and Ship2 would point to Ship, in that case Ship2 would be lost and there would be no way to access it, and it will be automatically deleted by BlitzMax. Ship/Ship2 is simply the addresses to these objects. One object can have several pointers to it. The object itself is unique but the address to it can reside in several different variables. Think about it.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="idx2" colspan="2"> 
Note the Global Fleet$. Because Fleet is a global in the SpaceShip type it is shared among all Instances of Spaceship. If one SpaceShip would change it's Fleet so would all other SpaceShips. Constants act in the same way, except they can't change. Because a global is global and not bound to an instance it can be altered even if you don't have any instances of the type in question.<br>
Try moving <span class="hw">&nbsp;SpaceShip.Fleet =</span><span class="hg"> "Quantum Light" </span>&nbsp;to the top of the file.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="idx2" colspan="2">
Types store data but what if I want to store types? You can always have types in types. But often we want to loop our types, move all spaceships. Sometimes we want to sort them. You might think that arrays would be the perfect choice, and so far it seems like a perfect fit. Arrays can contain objects, any object including your homemade.<p> 
If we collect all our objects into one place we would not need to refer to them with individual names, like ship1, ship2. We could use a eachin-loop and loop all objects.<p> 
The solution is called Lists. Lists are more dynamic than arrays and therefore offer a great advantage that makes your code easier. It's all about removing and adding objects. Arrays have a set length, lists do not. The length of a list is depending on the number of objects inside it. Study code below to see example.</td></tr>
